//Many functions are provided by JavaScript host environments that allow you to schedule asynchronous actions. 
//In other words, actions that we initiate now, but they finish later.

//For instance, one such function is the setTimeout function.

//There are other real-world examples of asynchronous actions, e.g. loading scripts and modules (weâ€™ll cover them in later chapters).
